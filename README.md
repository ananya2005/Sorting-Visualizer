# Sorting-Visualizer

This project involves visualisation of popular sorting algorithms. The purpose behind developing this program was to get well versed with the popular sorting algorithms. 
Watching the visualization of sorting algorithms helps to understand the internal workings of the algorithm, making it easier to reproduce these algorithms.

The project has been developed using Java SWING and visualizes sorts including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort and Insertion Sort.
